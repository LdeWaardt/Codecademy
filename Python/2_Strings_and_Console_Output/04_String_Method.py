# String methods let you perform specific tasks for strings.

# We'll focus on four string methods:

# len()
# lower()
# upper()
# str()
# Let's start with len(), which gets the length (the number of characters) of a string!

# PROBLEM: create a variable named parrot and set it to the string "Norwegian Blue". Type len(parrot) after the word print, like so: print len(parrot). The output will be the number of characters in "Norwegian Blue"!

parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
print len(parrot)
