#You can use the lower() method to get rid of all the capitalization in your strings. You call lower() like so:

"Ryan".lower()
# which will return "ryan".

# PROBLEM: Call lower() on parrot (after print) on line 3 in the editor

parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
print len(parrot)
print parrot.lower()

# PROBLEM: Call upper() on parrot (after print on line 3) in order to capitalize all the characters in the string!

parrot = "norwegian blue"
print parrot.upper()
