 # Text in Python is considered a specific type of data called a string. A string, so named because they're a series of letters, numbers, or symbols connected in order â€” as if threaded together by string. Strings can be defined in different ways. You can use single quotes or double quotes. We can combine multiple strings using +
 print "Hello " + "Lisa"
