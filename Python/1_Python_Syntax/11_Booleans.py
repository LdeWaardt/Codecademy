# Sometimes we have a need for variables that are either true or false. This datatype, which can only ever take one of two values, is called a boolean. In Python, we define booleans using the keywords True and False

# A boolean is actually a special case of an integer. A value of True corresponds to an integer value of 1, and will behave the same. A value of False corresponds to an integer value of 0

# PROBLEM: Someone has introduced themselves to you using comments in script.py. Read the comments and then create a variable called age_is_12 and set it to be True or False depending on if this person's age is 12.

# Hi! I'm Maria and I live in script.py.
# I'm an expert Python coder.
# I'm 21 years old and I plan to program cool stuff forever.

age_is_12 = False
name_is_maria = True
