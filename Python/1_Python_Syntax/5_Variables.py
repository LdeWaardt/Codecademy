# In Python, and when programming in general, we need to build systems for dealing with data that changes over time. That data could be the location of a plane, or the time of day, or the television show you're currently watching. The only important thing is that it may be different at different times. Python uses variables to define things that are subject to change.
# Create a variable called todays_date and assign a value that will represent today's date to that variable.
todays_date = "July 30, 2018"
